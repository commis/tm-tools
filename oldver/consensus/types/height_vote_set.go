/*
Keeps track of all VoteSets from round 0 to round 'round'.

Also keeps track of up to one RoundVoteSet greater than
'round' from each peer, to facilitate catchup syncing of commits.

A commit is +2/3 precommits for a block at a round,
but which round is not known in advance, so when a peer
provides a precommit for a round greater than mtx.round,
we create a new entry in roundVoteSets but also remember the
peer to prevent abuse.
We let each peer provide us with up to 2 unexpected "catchup" rounds.
One for their LastCommit round, and another for the official commit round.
